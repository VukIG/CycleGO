## Overview

The "CycleGo" high-fidelity prototype is a mobile app designed for bike challenge navigation. It was built using React and Vite, and is designed to be run as a web application. The app includes several key features:

* **Home Screen:** Shows recommendations for rides and progress on achievements. [[00:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=6)]
* **Trip Section:** Provides details on example trips, including location descriptions and points of interest. [[00:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=32)]
* **User Profile:** Displays user performance and health statistics, recently discovered places, and user achievements. [[01:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=72)]
* **Map:** Features bike-specific map markers and settings for customization. [[02:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=131)]

## Installation Requirements

To run the "CycleGo" prototype, you will need the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment.
* **npm:** The Node.js package manager.

## Operating Instructions

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can follow these steps to run the application:

1. Download and extract the prototype ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. The terminal will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) that you can open in your web browser to view the prototype.

## Limitations of the Implementation

The current version of the "CycleGo" prototype has some limitations due to time constraints:

* **Map Interactivity:** The map screen currently lacks interactive markers, settings to change the map appearance, and path suggestions. [[02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=132)]
* **Dynamic Data:** Many of the statistics and achievements displayed on the user profile are static and not yet linked to real-time tracking. [[01:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=73)]
* **Search Functionality:** The search functionality for locations and trips is not yet fully implemented. [[00:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySjU8z2cac&t=35)]
